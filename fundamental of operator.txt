ans 1

Statically typed: Programming languages are referred to as "Static typed" if the
memory of the variable is provided at the time of compilation.

For instance, C, C++, and Java

Dynamically typed: Programming languages are said to as "dynamically typed"
if the memory for the variable is provided at the time of execution.

Like Python, PHP, and JavaScript


ans 2


● A variable is the name of a memory-allocated reserved area. It may be thought of as
the name of a memory location, in other words.

● While the Java programme is running, the value is held in a container.

● To identify the storage location, each variable needs to have a special name.

● A data type is assigned to a variable (we will learn about it after this topic).

ans 3


Type variable_name = value;

The name of a variable is variable_name. The variable can be initialised by
supplying an equal sign and a value (initialization i.e. assigning an initial value, is
optional). However, a Java uninitialized local variable is never given a default
value by the compiler.


ans 4

Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte,
short, int, long, float and double.

ans 5

An identifier is a name given to a package, class, interface, method, or variable. All identifiers
must have different names.

ans 6

Operators in Java can be classified into 6 types:
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Relational Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Unary Operators
6. Bitwise Operators


ans 7

++ Increment

-- Decrement

In Java, the increment unary operator increases the value of the variable by one while the decrement unary operator decreases the value of the variable by one. Both update the value of the operand to its new value.
