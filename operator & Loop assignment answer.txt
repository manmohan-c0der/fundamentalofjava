When a condition consists of multiple boolean expressions, they are used. Use
conditional operators to combine two expressions, such as when we wish to print
a number only if it is larger than 2 and less than 5, respectively.

We have 3 types of conditional operators -
● Logical-and Operator(&&)
● Logical-or Operator(||)
● Ternary operator(?:)

ans 3

The switch case in java executes one statement from multiple ones. Thus, it is like an if-else-if ladder statement. It works with a lot of data types. The switch statement is used to test the equality of a variable against several values specified in the test cases



ans 4

 parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction.

ans 5

Java follows suit by using conditional statements to manage the program's flow.
This is crucial because at some time, in order to advance with our code, we must
fulfil requirements. For example, the console's yes or no input will determine
whether the programme is to be continued or cancelled.

Java has the following conditional statements:
● If statement
● else statement
● If-else Ternary
● Nested if-else
● Switch statement


ans 6

if(condition){  
//code if condition is true  
}else{  
//code if condition is false  
}  


ans 7
In Java, we have 3 types of iterative statements -

1. The while loop
2. The for loop
3. The do-while loop

ans 8
The difference between while and do while loops based on execution speed is that a do while loop runs faster than a while loop. The do-while is faster because it runs the first iteration without checking the loop condition. In contrast, the while loop checks the condition always.
